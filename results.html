Handpicking data is a little time consuming, but helps create clearer images by manually getting rid of some noise.<p>Right now there isn't a clear signal in this image other than what is probably natural drift. Hopefully with more events and looking at other stations we can see a tilt signal before an eruption.<h3>Fuego</h3>From the <a href=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2012GL051184>Lyons 2012</a> paper, I tried to recreate Figure 2.<p><img src=assets/img/figure-fuego.png class=img-fluid alt="Fuego Volcano, Lyons 2012 Figure 2 Recreation"><p>IF you compare this to the figure from the paper, you can see that the plot I got for station F9NE was pretty close, but the others are off in one way or another. Part of it is likely a problem in my code, likely within the filtering. I know some of the problems will arise in the events that I picked to use.<h3>Santiaguito</h3>Santiaguito has a station that has both a seismometer and a tiltmeter, as well as generally cleaner data than Fuego.<p><img src=assets/img/HHN6-final.png class=img-fluid alt="Tilt from Jan 2012"><p>This is tilt calculated from my code at just one channel at one time from Santiaguito. It is very close in shape to the tilt measured, though the large peaks detract from that. This data came from the north channel on station SJON.</article></main><footer><div class=copyright>Copyright Â© 2020</div><div class=feeds><a href=/feed.rss>RSS Feed</a> | <a href=/feed.atom>Atom Feed</a></div><div class=wyam-attribution>Generated by <a href=https://wyam.io>Wyam</a> with <a href=https://github.com/Ociaw/PlainBlog>Plain Blog</a></div></footer>
